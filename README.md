# Pluralsingh_EDA-PROJECT

Project Mindset Context:
For a better frame of reference, approach this project with this frame of mind:
The video player team is trying to better understand how learners use Pluralsight. As you do your analysis, formulate findings, and develop conclusions and recommendations, keep in mind that you are the team’s partner and your ability to clearly showcase and explain findings is just as critical as your ability to conduct analysis. 
Data Prompt:
Consider the following questions when conducting your analysis:
	•	What trends do you observe in searching or video consumption?
	•	What recommendations would you make to the search/video team about the learners, the visits, the content or the searches?
